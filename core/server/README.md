## Introduction

This module facilitates interaction with a ChatBot using WebSocket.

It allows users to initiate and manage workflows, send and receive messages from the ChatBot, and handle various events during the conversation.

## Features

- **WebSocket Interaction:** Establish WebSocket connections with ChatBot services.
- **Workflow Management:** Initiate and manage workflows based on user requests.
- **Message Handling:** Send and receive messages to/from the ChatBot in real-time.
- **Event Handling:** Handle WebSocket events such as acceptance, rejection, and errors.

## Data Processing

The module serves as a central hub for managing data processing activities in a streamlined manner.

Here's an overview of its role in the system:

- **Data Processing Initiation**: Users start the data processing journey by providing their data, such as request details, descriptions, and any additional information.
- **Data Classification**: The system's classification service takes this data and figures out the most suitable workflow to handle it. This classification helps in understanding what needs to be done with the data.
- **Data Storage**: Once the data is classified, it's stored for future reference. This stored information includes the original data, the identified workflow name, and how confident the system is in the classification.
- **Workflow Initiation**: In some cases, the classified data triggers a workflow. Workflows are sequences of tasks designed to handle specific types of data or requests. The system starts the appropriate workflow based on the classification.
- **Publishing Workflow Start**: When a workflow is initiated, the system publishes this information to ensure it gets started and executed correctly.
- **Client Interactions**: As the workflow progresses, clients (users or other parts of the system) may interact with it by providing responses or additional data. These interactions are published back to the system to keep the workflow moving forward.

In summary, the module simplifies the process of taking in data, understanding what to do with it, storing it for reference, and, when needed, starting workflows to handle that data.
It acts as a communication bridge between various parts of the system, making data processing more efficient and organized.
