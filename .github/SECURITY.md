# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not create a public GitHub issue.** Security vulnerabilities should not be publicly disclosed until they have been resolved.

2. Email us directly at [devops@spanning.com](mailto:devops@spanning.com) with your findings. Please include as much detail as possible, including:

   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Information about the affected versions.
   - Any additional information that may be relevant.

3. We will acknowledge your email within 3 business days and work with you to verify and address the vulnerability.

4. Once the vulnerability is verified and mitigated, we will create a GitHub security advisory to inform the community. We will credit you for your responsible disclosure if you wish to be acknowledged.

## Reporting Security Issues in Third-Party Dependencies

If you discover a security issue in a third-party library or component used by this project, please report it to the maintainers of that library. We are not responsible for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies, but we will work to update our project to use a secure version of the dependency.

## Security Measures

We take security seriously and are committed to providing a safe environment for our users. Here are some of the measures we have in place:

- Regular code reviews to identify and address security issues.
- Continuous integration and automated testing to catch vulnerabilities early.
- Prompt response to reported security vulnerabilities.
- Keeping dependencies up-to-date to include security fixes.
- Encouraging responsible disclosure and crediting security researchers for their efforts.

## Changes to this Policy

We may update this security policy from time to time to reflect changes in our security practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Check this page periodically for any updates. We will notify users about significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.

Thank you for helping us make this project secure!
